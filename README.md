## Background

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
1. $ npm install --global
2. Create config.js file inside the root folder using the config.example.js as a template
3. $ npm run server-dev
4. $ npm run react-dev
5. Go to http://127.0.0.1:1128
```

## Usage

This project is to showcase a full stack app with react, express, and mongoDB. Github Fetcher is an app that will take the most popular repositories from Github API and and sort them by stargazer count. You will also be able to add specific users to this list by searching for them at the top. Those users will also be sorted by stargazer count.
